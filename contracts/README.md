## Contracts Architecture

### CollateralSafekeep

- Manages vault for each user, allows users to lock/update ETH balance, withdrawals and protect liquidation.
- Allows users to mint rupio cross-chain or on home chain, if they have over-collateral locked in their vault.
- Integrated with AccessManager to restrict mod/admin only functions and monitor contract.
- Integrated with Chainlink automation to periodically calculate vault health of all vaults.
- Chainlink automation is used because for looping through all the vaults for vault health updation would be costly executing on-chain so we have chainlink as a saviour.
- Manages liquidations of vaults if vault health too low.
- Integrated with openzeppelin ownable and re-entrancy guard for security purposes.
- This contract is the foundational contract for RupioDao, all de-fi maths is encapsulated in this contract.

### PriceFeed

- Provides required ETH/USD and INR/USD prices to CollateralSafekeep contract for maintaining the peg.
- Integrated with Chainlink PriceFeeds for reliable oracle data.

### OracleLib

- A simple library contract to stale check the chainlink pricefeeds before sending over data to CollateralSafekeep.
- Stake checking means to check if the price is latest, or dormant.
- This library is used by the CollateralSafekeep contract to call PriceFeed contract.

### Rupio

- Token contract for Rupio token, which maintains its peg on 1 INR always.
- Integrated with LayerZero cross-chain solutions to make Rupio token cross-transferable and mintable.
- AccessManager restricts minting of Rupio tokens without access.

### AccessManager

- An admin contract that allows adding of more moderators, revoking roles, granting minter and mod roles.
- This contract is used to restrict certain moderator-only functions all over the contracts of RupioDao.

### RupioSavingsContract

- This contract allows users to lock their Rupio tokens and earn intrest on them.
- This is used as a RupioDao incentivizing protocol for situations where Rupio tokens are needed to be circulated.

### Governance

- This contract allows stake-holders or investors to participate in governance decisions, for example setting intrest rates, ratios, thresholds and platform fees.

## Frameworks and Tools used

- Foundry : For testing and deployment
- Chainlink Automation : For periodically updating vault health of all vaults.
- Chainlink Pricefeeds : For providing price rates from oracles
- LayerZero : For making Rupio token cross-chain compatible
- OpenZeppelin : Used in governance contract, and allover the system for ownable, time-locks and such

- Main contracts are thoroughly tested, including fuzz tests.

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
